# Toum (Garlic Spread)

## Ingredients
- 100g fresh garlic or degermed garlic
- 50g fresh lemon juice, cold, with pulp strained out
- 250g oil
- 1 teaspoons salt


## Directions
 1. Peel garlic and slice in half. Remove the germ from the center of each clove. 
 2. Place garlic and salt in food processor and process until finely minced, scraping sides periodically.
 3. When finely minced add a teaspoon of lemon juice and process again for a minute, scraping the bowl every 15 seconds.
 4. Add one more teaspoon of lemon and process until a fluffy and fine paste forms
 5. When the garlic has fluffed up, start food processor, and slowly drizzle in 1/2 a cup of the oil. Drizzle it slowly with just a thin thread. It should take about 2 minutes with the first half cup. Do not proceed with the recipe until the first half cup has emulsified and thickened.
 6. Once the first half cup has emulsified slowly drizzle in a tablespoon of lemon juice
 7. Alternate drizzling in 1/2 a cup of oil and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice until both have finished
 8. Once completed, place the sauce in a container and cover with a paper towel pressed against the surface to absorb liquid. Let it rest overnight before serving.
