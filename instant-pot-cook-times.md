# Instant Pot Cook Times

## Beans
Ideally, soak beans for ~12 hours. Discard the soaking water and replace with 
enough fresh water to cover the beans with an inch of water. If beans are not  
soaked, add 3 parts water for each part dry beans. When cooking add 1/2 teaspoon 
salt per cup of beans.

Cook on high pressure with 15 minute natural release. The cook times below 
produce tender but firm beans. For softer beans add more time.
