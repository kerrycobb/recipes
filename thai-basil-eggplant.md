# Thai Basil Eggplant

## Ingredients
- 275 grams Japanese eggplant 
- 6 cloves garlic
- Fresh Red Thai chilies
- 200 g ground chicken, pork or crumbled firm tofu
- 1 cup Thai basil leaves

### Sauce
- 2 Tbsp Nam Prik Pao 
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tsp fish sauce
- 2 tsp oyster sauce
- 2 Tbsp water

## Directions
1. Mix all sauce ingredients together. 
2. Chop or pound in mortar and pestle the chilis and garlic.
3. Add just enough oil to coat the bottom of a hot wok and add the eggplant. Cook ~10 minutes, tossing occasionally. Remove eggplant before it is completely cooked and transfer to bowl.
4. Add a bit more oil to the wok and sauté the garlic and chili for ~ 1 minute.
5. Add the protein and sauté until nearly done. 
6. Add the eggplant and the sauce, then keep tossing for about 2-3 minutes until the eggplant is fully cooked but not mushy. 
7. Add the basil, turn off the heat, then toss for 30 more seconds using the residual heat to wilt the basil.
