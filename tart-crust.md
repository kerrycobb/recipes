# Tart Crust
https://www.theflavorbender.com/pate-sucree-basics-sweet-shortcrust-pastry/

## Ingredients
For 9 inch tart pan
- 150 grams all-purpose flour
- 75 grams unsalted butter, room temperature
- 60 grams powdered sugar 
- 35 grams egg or egg yolks, room temperature (egg yolks will make it richer and with less gluten development)
- Pinch of salt
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest (optional)

## Directions
    In a large bowl, place the butter and salt. Using a spatula or a hand whisk, mix the butter until you get a soft and creamy texture (like a thick body cream or lotion!).
    Sift the confectioner's sugar, and add it to the butter mixture.
    Mix the sugar in until it's completely mixed in with the butter.
    Whisk the egg yolks (or whole eggs), and add this to the butter sugar mixture along with the vanilla extract (and lemon zest, if using).
    Incorporate the egg mixture into the butter until smooth.
    Sift the flour, and add it to the egg, butter, and sugar mixture.
    Gently mix in the flour. I like to use a spatula and mix the dough by cutting through the dough several times (see pictures in the post).
    Turn the dough out onto a work surface lined with parchment paper. Use the parchment paper to fold the dough over to incorporate all of the flour. If you used whole eggs, take extra care to not overwork the gluten in the dough.
    The dough will be very soft and a little sticky. This is normal. Handle the dough gently with floured hands.
    Cut the dough in half and shape each dough into a disc. Wrap each disc with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to chill. If your tart mold is a rectangle or square, shape the dough into a rough square instead of a disc.
    Lightly flour your work surface. Place one of the chilled pate sucree discs on the work surface. Knock it a few times with the rolling pin to soften the dough and make it more pliable.
    Start rolling out the dough, turning the dough a ¼ circle every few rolls. This makes it easy to maintain a circle and also prevents the dough from sticking to the counter. If any cracks appear, shape the dough to seal those cracks as you go. If the dough gets too soft, carefully transfer it to the fridge for a few minutes to let it slightly harden again, OR roll it out between two parchment paper sheets.
    The dough needs to be rolled out to a thickness of 3mm. If at any stage the dough shrinks as you roll it out, that is an indication that the dough has been overworked.
    Transfer the dough onto a tray, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rest in the fridge for about 10-20 minutes. Then resume rolling it out afterwards.

For tart pans

    Line the bottom of a 9 inch tart pan (1 inch height) with parchment paper, and lightly butter the sides.
    Transfer the rolled out pate sucree onto the tart pan, but make sure it’s not stretched out over the pan. Gently and carefully press the dough into the sides, edges and bottom of the pan. With a rolling pin, roll over the surface of the tart pan. This will trim off any excess overhang dough.
    Dock the bottom of the pan with a fork. Cover the surface with plastic wrap, and let the dough chill in the freezer for at least 30 minutes until firm.

For a tart ring

    Place an 8 inch tart ring on a silpat lined baking tray and lightly butter the side of the tart ring. Using the tart ring, cut a circle in the rolled out dough. Make sure to cut the circle from the edge of the rolled out dough, with enough dough to cut 1 – 1.5 inch strips.
    Place the ring on the silpat, then place the round dough that you cut inside the tart ring.
    Cut strips of dough that are a little taller than the sides of the tart pan (about 1 inch for the ones I use).
    Brush the edge of the round dough with water, and line the strips of dough along the side of the tart ring. Make sure the strips are placed flush against the round dough on the bottom, so that it forms a seal.
    Dock the bottom of the tart shell with a fork. Cover the tart shell with plastic wrap and let it chill in the freezer for at least 30 minutes until firm.

How to blind bake the pate sucree tart shell

    Preheat the oven to 350°F / 180°C.
    Place the chilled pate sucree lined tart pan on a baking tray (the tart ring should already be on a baking tray).
    Take a piece of parchment paper that is large enough to fit inside the pan (with some overhang), and crumple it up. Be careful not to tear it.
    Now unfold the parchment paper, and place it on top of the chilled dough. Weigh the parchment paper down against the tart dough with pie weights, or dry beans, or dry rice, or sugar. The parchment paper overhang should go over the edges to prevent the edges from browning too quickly.
    Bake in the preheated oven for about 20 – 25 minutes, until the edges are just starting to brown.
    Remove the tart from the oven, and carefully lift the parchment paper with the pie weights and set it aside.
    If you're baking the tart with a filling, this is where the filling would be used to fill the tart and then baked until the filling is set.

To completely bake the tart shell

    If necessary, dock the bottom of the pan again, and return the tart pan to the oven to bake until golden brown. This can take about 10 – 15 minutes.
    If you want to egg wash the tart shell, remove it from the oven 5 minutes before it’s done baking (when it’s a light golden color), and brush the entire surface and edges with an egg wash (whisked whole egg, or egg yolk + milk). Return it to the oven and bake for a further 5 minutes until the shell is golden brown and has a sheen.
    Remove from the oven and let it cool down slightly. When just cool enough to handle, remove the tart shell from the pan / ring and let it cool completely to room temperature on a cooling wire rack.
