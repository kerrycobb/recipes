Should try adding egg white to batter to see if it sticks to the chicken better.

This is an interesting technique for adding additional starch just before frying.

Make a thick batter that is half flour, half potato starch or corn starch, 
and has some acid and salt.
Let marinade for a few hours.
Dredge chicken pieces in a bit of potato starch if a really thick breading is 
desired. 
Place chicken into the oil 325 &deg;F oil.
Remove from the oil once internal temperature hits 160&deg;F.
Small pieces will be done with first fry after 2 minutes.
Rest for a few minutes on a wire rack.
Fry again for 2 minutes after letting chicken rest for a bit.


<!-- Set induction burner to 7. Once temp reaches 325, add chicken and cook for 2 
minutes. The temp stays around around 330-335 during cook time. Internal temp 
coming out of fryer is ~170. Start next batch when temp again reaches 345. 
Fry a second time at 375F.  -->
