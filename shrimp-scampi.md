# Shrimp Scampi

## Ingredients
- 3 tablespoons salt
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 1/2 pounds shell-on jumbo shrimp (16 to 20 per pound), peeled, deveined, and tails removed, shells reserved
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 4 sprigs fresh thyme
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice, plus lemon wedges for serving
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch
- 8 garlic cloves, sliced thin
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

## Directions
1. Dissolve salt and sugar in 1quart cold water in a large container. Submerge shrimp in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Remove shrimp from brine and pat dry with paper towels.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add shrimp shells and cook, frequently stirring, until they begin to turn spotty brown and skillet starts to brown (2 to 4 minutes). Remove skillet from heat and carefully add wine and thyme sprigs. When bubbling subsides, return skillet to medium heat and simmer gently, occasionally stirring, for 5 minutes—strain mixture through a colander set over a large bowl. Discard shells and reserve liquid (you should have about 2/3 cup)—Wipeout skillet with paper towels.
3. Combine lemon juice and cornstarch in a small bowl. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil, garlic, pepper flakes, and pepper in now-empty skillet over medium-low heat, occasionally stirring, until garlic is fragrant and just beginning to brown at edges, 3 to 5minutes. Add reserved wine mixture, increase heat to high, and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium, add shrimp, cover, and cook, occasionally stirring, until shrimp are just opaque, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and, using a slotted spoon, transfer shrimp to a bowl.
4. Return skillet to medium heat, add lemon juice–cornstarch mixture, and cook until slightly thickened, 1 minute. Remove from heat and whisk in butter and parsley until combined. Return shrimp and any accumulated juices to skillet and toss to combine. Serve, passing lemon wedges separately.
