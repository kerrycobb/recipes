## Ingredients
- Dried corn
- 1% calcium hydroxide (cal) by weight proportional to the weight of corn
- Water to cover corn

## Directions
1. Clean and rinse dried corn.
2. Cover with water with an inch of water and stir in cal.
3. Bring to boil, drop to low simmer, and cook for 30 minutes.
4. Try a piece of corn. It should be cooked almost all the way through but still have a slightly chalky center which could take up to one hour.
5. Allow corn to cool and let it sit 14-16 hours.  
6. After soaking dump corn into colander and rinse while rubbing kernels between your hands to remove the slimy pericarp. Remove between 50% and 100% of pericarp depending on preference.
