# Notes On Thickeners

## Gelatin
- Sprinkle over cold water and allow to sit for 10 minutes and absorb water. Then melt by heating above 122&deg;F.
- Never allow to boil.
- 1 tablespoon of gelatin in 2 cups of liquid will result in a firm product that holds its shape when removed from a mold.
- 1 tablespoon of gelatin in 3 cups of liquid will result in a product that does not hold its shape when removed from a mold.
- 1 tablespoon of gelatin granules is equal to 4 standard sheets of leaf gelatin.
- Solids can be added in up to a 1:1 ratio of gelatin mixture to solids. First cool the gelatin until it thickens a bit before mixing solids.
- Uncooked pineapple, figs, kiwi, guava, and ginger contain an enzyme called bromelain which breaks down gelatin.
- Before pouring into a mold, rinse mold with cold water to make it easier to remove. Dip mold in hot water for 10 seconds before loosening the edges with a spatula or knife. Can also grease the mold. 
- 2-4 hours should be sufficient to harden gelatin depending on the depth of the mold.
- Keep gelatin dishes covered to prevent formation of a thick skin. 
- To center a mold on a plate, rinse with cold water so that mold can be repositioned once transferred.
- High concentrations of sugar will soften the final product
