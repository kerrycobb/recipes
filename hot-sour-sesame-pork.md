# Ingredients
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- ½ onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- ½ Chinese leaf, chopped into chunks
- 300g minced pork

## Marinade
- 1 tsp Amoy sesame oil
- 1 tsp Korean chilli powder
- ½ tsp sea salt
- Pinch Rajah black pepper

## Sauce
- 1 tbsp peanut butter / sesame paste
- 1 ½ tbsp Amoy light soy sauce
- ½ tbsp tabasco sauce
- 1 teaspoon Amoy rice vinegar
- ½ tsp sugar
- 1 tsp chiu chow chilli oil (add at end)
- 1 teaspoon Amoy sesame oil

# Directions
1. Marinate the pork. 
2. Roughly chop the garlic and dice the onion. 
3. Chop the lettuce into chunks. 
4. Make the sauce. 
5. Get the wok up to a high heat, with a ladle of oil added. Add the onions and garlic first, and flash fry those until the onion loses its raw texture, a minute at most. Push those to the back of the wok, add some extra oil, and then add the pork. Place the onions and garlic over the top of the pork so they don’t burn, and keep chopping into the pork and folding over, until browned. 
6. Remove the pork, and add a little oil, to flash fry the chinese leaf. Once the leaf is in the wok, add the pork over the top and then add the sauce . Give that a wok toss, and allow the heat to build up again. Add the chilli oil and a little water and flick through until the sauce coats the pork throughout. Serve hot, enjoy!
