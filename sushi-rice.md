## Ingredients
### Rice
- 180 ml short grain rice such as Koshihikari
- 180 ml water
- 2x2 inch strip kombu

### Sushi vinegar
- 175 grams rice vinegar
- 120 grams sugar

## Directions
1. Rinse rice with a strainer and add to rice cooker.
2. Optionally, soak rice for 20-30 minutes to improve texture.
3. Add water and kombu.
4. Cook rice and stir partway through to stop rice from burning on the bottom.
5. While rice is cooking, heat vinegar, sugar, and salt on stove with low heat until everything is dissolved and immediately remove from heat.
